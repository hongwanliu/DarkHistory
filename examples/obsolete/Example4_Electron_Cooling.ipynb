    "Excitation will be a little confusing. For 1s -> 2p hydrogen excitation, the electron loses 10.2 eV, producing a secondary electron (which is resolved), and 10.2 eV is assigned to deposited. For 1s -> 2s, the electron loses 10.2 eV, but the photons produced are assigned to continuum. For He+, the electron loses ~21 eV (and resolved), producing a 21 eV photon. 13.6 eV should then be assigned to ionization deposited energy, and the remaining 7.4 eV assigned to heating (corresponding to a secondary electron that can only contribute to heating). \n",
