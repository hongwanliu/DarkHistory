This module takes an injected electron with some initial energy, and cools it completely through inverse Compton scattering (ICS) as well as ionization, excitation (both on HI, HeI and HeII) as well as Coulomb heating of free electrons.

    "Let's add up all the energy in atomic processes plus low-energy electrons. First, we get the low-energy electrons, which is saved as a [*TransFuncAtRedshift*](https://darkhistory.readthedocs.io/en/master/_autosummary/darkhistory/spec/transferfunction/darkhistory.spec.transferfunction.TransFuncAtRedshift.html). We can obtain the total energy for each injected electron using `TransFuncAtRedshift.toteng()`. The function `toteng()` sums over the the last axis, i.e. it sums the energy of all photons in each spectrum corresponding to an injected electron. This can then be added to the other components to get the total energy deposited as atomic processes. "

     "abstract": "We provide ingredients and recipes for computing signals of TeV-scale Dark Matter annihilations and decays in the Galaxy and beyond. For each DM channel, we present the energy spectra of at production, computed by high-statistics simulations. We estimate the Monte Carlo uncertainty by comparing the results yielded by the Pythia and Herwig event generators. We then provide the propagation functions for charged particles in the Galaxy, for several DM distribution profiles and sets of propagation parameters. Propagation of e± is performed with an improved semi-analytic method that takes into account position-dependent energy losses in the Milky Way. Using such propagation functions, we compute the energy spectra of e±,p̄ and d̄ at the location of the Earth. We then present the gamma ray fluxes, both from prompt emission and from Inverse Compton scattering in the galactic halo. Finally, we provide the spectra of extragalactic gamma rays. All results are available in numerical form and ready to be consumed.",
