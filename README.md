Added Neural Network transfer functions to replace large tabulated transfer functions. Requires [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) in addition to existing dependencies, and a newer (but smaller) set of data files available [here](). Updating from v1.0 requires a small expansion set of data files available [here](). (This version of DarkHistory is compatible with v1.0 data set (requires setting `use_v1_0_data=True` in config.py) if not using the Neural Network transfer functions functionalities.) The update is described in a paper available at [arXiv:2206.xxxx](). Please cite this paper as well as [arXiv:1904.09296](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09296) if you use this version of DarkHistory in a scientific publication. The release for this version can be found [here](). For more information, please visit our webpage [here](https://darkhistory.readthedocs.io).

DarkHistory is a Python code package that calculates the global temperature and ionization history of the universe given an exotic source of energy injection, such as dark matter annihilation or decay. DarkHistory is described in a paper available at [arXiv:1904.09296](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09296). Please cite this paper if you use DarkHistory in a scientific publication. The data files for required for this version can be found [here](). The release for this version can be found [here](https://github.com/hongwanliu/DarkHistory/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
