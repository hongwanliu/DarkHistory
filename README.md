# New formats for required data files

For versatility, all data files required to use DarkHistory have been converted to HDF5, JSON, and plain text files. All active branches of DarkHistory have been updated to use the new set of data files. You can download the new data files at the [following link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13259509).

# DarkHistory, with improved treatment of low energy electrons and spectral distortions

In additional to the data files needed for v1.0, this upgrade requires [additional data files](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7651517).

The upgrades are described in a paper available at [arXiv:2303.07366](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07366), and examples of applications are given in [arXiv:2303.07370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07370). Please cite these as well as [arXiv:1904.09296](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09296) if you use this version of DarkHistory in a scientific publication.

DarkHistory is a Python code package that calculates the global temperature and ionization history of the universe given an exotic source of energy injection, such as dark matter annihilation or decay. DarkHistory is described in a paper available at [arXiv:1904.09296](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09296). Please cite this paper if you use DarkHistory in a scientific publication.
