Added Neural Network transfer functions to optionally replace large tabulated transfer functions. Requires [Tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) in addition to v1.0 dependencies, and a [compact dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6819281) to use the Neural Network transfer functions. (To upgrade from v1.0, one can simply add the compact dataset to the existing data directory). To use the tabulated transfer functions, a [full dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6819310) is required. (This version of DarkHistory also works with v1.0 dataset with setting `use_v1_0_data=True` in config.py.)

The update is described in a paper available at [arXiv:2207.06425](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06425). Please cite this paper as well as [arXiv:1904.09296](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09296) if you use this version of DarkHistory in a scientific publication.

DarkHistory is a Python code package that calculates the global temperature and ionization history of the universe given an exotic source of energy injection, such as dark matter annihilation or decay. DarkHistory is described in a paper available at [arXiv:1904.09296](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09296). Please cite this paper if you use DarkHistory in a scientific publication. The data files for required for this version can be found [here](). The release for this version can be found [here](https://github.com/hongwanliu/DarkHistory/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
